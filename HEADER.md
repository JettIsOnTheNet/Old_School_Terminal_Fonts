# Old School Terminal Fonts Collection
This is a collection of old school terminal fonts graciously provided by [int10h](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts) that have been patched with ligatures from Nerd Fonts.

Click any font to download it directly, or clone this repo.

If you would like to patch your own set or repatch any font, a script is provided. First, download the fonts zip file from [int10h](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts). Select the fonts you would like to patch and put them into the ttf directory inside the cloned repo. Download [NerdFonts Font-Patcher.zip](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), unzip that also into the directory you cloned this repo into, then use [FontForge](https://fontforge.org) via the provided patch_fonts.sh script.

If you would like to generate preview images, create a conda environment and use the requirements.txt to install the requirements, then run generate_readme.py.
